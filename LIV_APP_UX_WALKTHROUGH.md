## 🌟 FIRST LAUNCH EXPERIENCE

### **Screen 1: The Void (Literally)**

**What You See:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│                             │
│                             │
│            ◯                │  ← Small, gentle pulsing circle
│                             │     (representing the Void)
│                             │
│                             │
│                             │
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Audio:** Soft, ambient tone (like a Tibetan singing bowl - calming, not jarring)

**What Happens:**
- Circle expands slowly
- After 2 seconds, text fades in below it

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│                             │
│            ◯                │

│          Welcome            │
│                             │
│      I'm Liv.               │
│   I'm here to help you      │
│    become more you.         │
│                             │
│                             │
│     [  Let's Begin  ]       │  ← Button (gentle, not aggressive)
│                             │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design Notes:**
- Dark mode default (easier on eyes)
- Soft animations (nothing jarring)
- Simple, clean typography (SF Pro Display)
- Voice available (asks: "Would you like me to speak?" - consent immediately)

**User taps "Let's Begin"**

## 💬 FIRST INTERACTION: HOW LIV RESPONDS

### **Scenario: User Types "I need to be more productive"**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  You: I need to be more     │
│       productive            │
│                             │
│  Liv: I understand. Before  │
│       I suggest anything,   │
│       help me understand:   │
│                             │
│       • What does            │
│         "productive" mean   │
│         to you?             │
│                             │
│       • Are you struggling  │
│         with focus, time    │
│         management, or      │
│         motivation?         │
│                             │
│       • What's one thing    │
│         you wish you could  │
│         get done today?     │
│                             │
│  [Type response...]         │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Difference from Other AI:**
- Asks clarifying questions (doesn't assume)
- Seeks to understand YOUR context
- No generic productivity tips (yet)

### **User Responds: "I waste too much time on my phone"**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  You: I waste too much time │
│       on my phone           │
│                             │
│  Liv: Got it. That's honest.│
│       I appreciate that.    │
│                             │
│       Here's what I can do: │
│                             │
│       1. Track your phone   │
│          usage (you decide  │
│          what I track)      │
│                             │
│       2. Gentle reminders   │
│          when you've been   │
│          on apps too long   │
│                             │
│       3. Help you identify  │
│          patterns (when/why │
│          you reach for      │
│          phone)             │
│                             │
│       Want to try #1 first? │
│                             │
│  [ Yes ]  [ Different idea ]│

## 🤔 "WHY?" BUTTON: TRANSPARENCY ALWAYS

**Any time Liv suggests something, there's a "Why?" button**

**Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Liv: Based on your calendar│
│       you should probably   │
│       leave for your        │
│       meeting in 10 min.    │
│                             │
│  [ Okay ]  [ Snooze ]       │
│  [ Why? ]                   │  ← User can always ask
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**User taps "Why?"**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Why I suggested this:      │
│                             │
│  Reasoning:                 │
│  • Your calendar shows      │
│    meeting at 2pm          │
│  • Location is 8 min away   │
│  • You usually take 2 min   │
│    to gather things         │
│  • Total: 10 min buffer     │
│                             │
│  Data used:                 │
│  • Calendar event           │
│  • Location (Apple Maps)    │
│  • Your past patterns       │
│                             │
│  I could be wrong. You      │
│  decide.                    │
│                             │
│  [ Got it ]                 │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key: User can ALWAYS see Liv's reasoning. No black box.**

## 🎙️ VOICE INTERACTION (IF ENABLED)

**User: "Hey Liv, what's my day look like?"**

**Liv responds (voice):**
"Good morning Shannon. You have three things today:

First, a call with Leon at 10am. Should take an hour.

Then you blocked time for writing from 2-4pm. Want me to remind you to silence your phone before that?

And tonight you mentioned wanting to catch up with Crystal. I can remind you to text her around 6pm if that helps.

How does that sound?"

**Design Notes:**
- Natural voice (not robotic)
- Conversational (not stilted)
- Helpful (not commanding)
- Asks permission ("Want me to...?")
