## 🔒 PRIVACY POLICY TEMPLATE

### **H SOLUTIONS LIMITED - LIV APP PRIVACY POLICY**

**Effective Date:** [Date]
**Last Updated:** November 27, 2025

---

### **Our Philosophy**

Liv is built on a simple principle: **Your data is yours. Period.**

Unlike most apps that collect everything and ask questions later, we collect almost nothing. And what we do collect, we handle with extreme care.

This isn't marketing speak. This is how Liv works.

---

### **1. What Data We Collect**

#### **A. Data Stored Locally on Your Device (Most Data)**

**What:** Everything you do in Liv stays on YOUR device by default.

**Includes:**
- Your conversations with Liv
- Your preferences and settings
- Unlocked features and progress
- Personal notes, tasks, calendars
- Health data (if you use health features)
- Financial data (if you use finance features)

**Who can access:** ONLY YOU. We literally can't see it—it never leaves your device.

**Storage:** Encrypted on your device. Protected by your device's security (passcode, Face ID, etc.)

**Retention:** Until you delete it. Forever if you want. Gone immediately if you don't.

---

#### **B. Data We Collect (Minimal, Only If Needed)**

**What we collect and why:**

| Data Type | Why We Collect It | How We Use It |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| **Email** | Account creation | Authentication only. No marketing unless you opt-in |
| **Payment info** | Process subscription | Via Stripe/Apple/Google (we don't store card numbers) |
| **Crash reports** | Fix bugs | Anonymous crash logs to improve app stability |
| **Usage analytics** (optional) | Improve Liv | ONLY if you opt-in. Aggregated, anonymous data |

**What we DON'T collect:**
- ❌ Your conversations (stay on device)
- ❌ Your location (unless you're using location features, and it stays local)
- ❌ Your contacts (unless you explicitly share them)
- ❌ Your browsing history
- ❌ Anything from other apps
- ❌ Anything we don't need

---

#### **C. Cloud Sync (Optional Feature)**

**If you enable Cloud Sync:**
- Your data syncs across your devices via encrypted cloud storage
- End-to-end encrypted (even we can't read it)
- You control what syncs (can exclude sensitive categories)
- Delete cloud data anytime from settings

**If you DON'T enable Cloud Sync:**
- Everything stays local (fully offline mode)
- No data leaves your device
- You can still use 95% of Liv's features

---

### **2. How We Use Your Data**

**Simple answer: We don't.**

**Longer answer:**

| Purpose | What We Do | What We DON'T Do |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| **Improve Liv** | Aggregate, anonymous usage stats (if you opt-in) | ❌ Track individual users |
| **Customer Support** | Help you if something breaks | ❌ Access your conversations |
| **Billing** | Charge for subscription | ❌ Sell payment info |
| **Legal Requirements** | Comply with law (only if required) | ❌ Volunteer data to anyone |

**We never:**
- Sell your data (NEVER)
- Share your data without explicit consent
- Use your data for advertising
- Train AI models on your conversations
- Give data to third parties (except payment processors, and even then it's minimal)

---

### **3. Data Sharing**

**Who we share with: Almost no one.**

**Exceptions (only when necessary):**

1. **Payment Processors** (Stripe, Apple, Google)
   - **What:** Payment info, subscription status
   - **Why:** To process payments
   - **Control:** Handled by them (we don't store card numbers)

2. **Cloud Storage Provider** (if you enable Cloud Sync)
   - **What:** Encrypted data (even they can't read it)
   - **Why:** To sync across devices
   - **Control:** End-to-end encrypted

3. **Law Enforcement** (only if legally required)
   - **What:** Minimal info we're legally required to provide
   - **Why:** Court order, subpoena, or emergency
   - **Control:** We fight overbroad requests

**We NEVER:**
- Sell data to advertisers
- Share with data brokers
- Give to other apps/companies
- "Anonymize and sell" (still NO)

---

### **4. Your Rights (Every Single One)**

✅ **Access:** See all data we have about you (spoiler: almost nothing)
✅ **Delete:** Delete your account and all associated data permanently

- Content censorship

**Our Position:**
- Can't comply while maintaining privacy promises
- Considering China-specific version with:
  - Separate legal entity
  - China-only data storage

**Future:** May launch with transparency about limitations

---

**Our Approach:**

### **H. Regional Purchase Power Parity Pricing**

**Why Different Prices:**

- Fair pricing = adjust to local economy

**Implementation:**
- Detect user's country (IP or payment method)
- Adjust price to local purchasing power
- Same features, fair price

**Anti-Arbitrage:**
- VPN detection (payment method must match region)
- Frequent region changes flagged (abuse prevention)
