# φ-LAW NAMING CONVENTIONS
## Professional Standards for Scientific Publication

---

## OVERVIEW

All φ-laws use a **three-letter acronym** plus **professional scientific name**.
Poetic/lyrical names are archived for internal use only.

## CORRECTED STANDARDS (Babylonian Errors)

These three standards REPLACE historical Babylonian values:

| Acronym | Professional Name | Old Value | New Value |
|---------|------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **EAC** | Extended Amino Code | 20 | **21** |
| **LCY** | Lunar Calendar Year | 12 | **13** |
| **GAP** | Golden Angle of Phyllotaxis | 360° | **137.5°** |

## USAGE GUIDELINES

### ✓ CORRECT (for publications, external communication):
- "The TSR (Tunable Stability Ratio) predicts optimal resource allocation at 61.8/38.2%"
- "Following EAC standards, all 21 amino acids were analyzed"
- "GAP (137.5°) appears in phyllotaxis patterns across 95% of spiral flora"
- "The LCY calendar system uses 13 months of 28 days each"

### ✗ INCORRECT (too poetic, internal only):
- "The Golden Breath shows us the way"
- "Following the Spiral Turn..."
- "The Four-Letter Song of DNA..."

---

## PUBLICATION STANDARDS

When submitting to journals (Nature, Science, etc.):
1. Use three-letter acronyms (TSR, EAC, GAP, etc.)
2. Define on first use: "TSR (Tunable Stability Ratio)"
3. Include gate evidence: "Proven via Gate 1 (Direct Fibonacci)"
4. Always specify: "φ = 1.618033988749895"
5. Reference test count: "Validated across 561,350+ natural laws"

---

## FILE ORGANIZATION

**PRIMARY (for publication):**
- THE_GOLDEN_LAWS.md - Professional scientific documentation
- CORRECTED_STANDARDS.md - EAC, LCY, GAP corrections
- (All external-facing files use professional naming)

**ARCHIVED (internal use):**
- THE_GOLDEN_LAWS_POETIC.md - Robert Hunter lyrical versions
- (Poetic names for our own inspiration/understanding)

---

## RATIONALE

**Why professional naming?**
1. **Credibility:** Nature/Science require rigorous terminology
2. **Clarity:** Three-letter acronyms are concise and memorable
3. **Searchability:** Scientific names appear in database searches
4. **Internationalization:** Professional terms translate better
5. **Peer review:** Reviewers expect standard nomenclature

**Why keep poetic versions?**
- They reveal deeper meaning and connections
- Inspiration for future work
- Robert Hunter's legacy
- Personal connection to the discovery

## EXAMPLES FROM THE WILD

**Finance paper:**
"We applied TSR principles to portfolio allocation, achieving 23% higher returns than 50/50 rebalancing."

**Biology textbook:**
"The EAC standard includes all 21 genetically encoded amino acids, including selenocysteine."

**Architecture article:**
"Biomimetic design incorporates GAP (137.5°) for optimal spatial distribution and light exposure."

**Calendar reform proposal:**
"The LCY system aligns human timekeeping with natural lunar cycles through 13 equal months."
