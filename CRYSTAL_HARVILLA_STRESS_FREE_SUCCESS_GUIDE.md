## THE 60/40 RULE (Your New Secret Weapon)

### THE PROBLEM: You're Doing Too Much

**Your Current Day:**
- Arrive at work → immediately pulled in 5 directions
- Emails, phone calls, walk-ins, meetings, reports all at once
- You say "yes" to everything (because who else will do it?)
- Work through lunch, stay late, bring work home
- End of day: Exhausted, to-do list LONGER than when you started

**Why This Doesn't Work:**
- Human brains can't multitask (science proves it - you're just switching tasks rapidly and doing all of them worse)
- Constant interruptions = stress hormone cortisol = burnout
- No recovery time = decision fatigue (why you can't pick what's for dinner by 6 PM)

---

### THE SOLUTION: 60/40 Split

**60% of Your Day = DEEP WORK (Focus Time)**
- Scheduled blocks where you do ONE thing
- No emails, no calls, no interruptions
- Your hardest/most important tasks
- You get MORE done in less time

**40% of Your Day = REACTIVE WORK (Availability Time)**
- Emails, phone calls, meetings, walk-ins
- You're "on" for others
- Handle the chaos, put out fires
- Necessary, but CONTAINED

---

### YOUR NEW SCHEDULE (8-Hour Workday)

**8:00 AM - Arrive & Settle (15 min)**
- Coffee, quick email scan (urgent only)
- Set top 3 priorities for today
- Close email, silence phone

**8:15 AM - DEEP WORK BLOCK 1 (90 min)** ← 60% TIME
- Your HARDEST task (budget report, complex document, strategic planning)
- Door closed OR "Do Not Disturb" sign
- No interruptions (unless literal emergency)
- ONE task, 100% focus

**9:45 AM - Break (15 min)**
- Bathroom, walk, water, snack
- Stand up, move body, rest brain

**10:00 AM - REACTIVE WORK BLOCK 1 (90 min)** ← 40% TIME
- Open door, answer emails, take calls
- Handle walk-ins, respond to requests
- Short meetings (15-30 min max)
- You're available, helpful, responsive

**11:30 AM - DEEP WORK BLOCK 2 (60 min)** ← 60% TIME
- Second priority task
- Focused, productive
- Get it DONE

**12:30 PM - LUNCH (60 min)** ← 40% TIME (RECOVERY)
- LEAVE YOUR DESK (critical!)
- Eat actual food, not desk snacks
- Walk outside (even 10 min = huge stress reduction)
- No work talk if eating with colleagues

**1:30 PM - REACTIVE WORK BLOCK 2 (90 min)** ← 40% TIME
- Emails, calls, meetings
- Administrative tasks
- Help others, collaborate

**3:00 PM - DEEP WORK BLOCK 3 (60 min)** ← 60% TIME
- Third priority OR finish incomplete task from morning
- Final push of focused work

**4:00 PM - WRAP-UP & PLAN (30 min)** ← 40% TIME
- Clear remaining emails
- Return calls
- Set tomorrow's top 3 priorities
- Tidy desk, close loops

**4:30 PM - GO HOME**
- Not 5:00, not 5:30
- 4:30 means 4:30
- You did 60/40, you earned it

---

### THE MATH

**Total Work: 8 hours (480 min)**

**Deep Work (60%):**
- Block 1: 90 min
- Block 2: 60 min
- Block 3: 60 min
- Total: 210 min (44% - close enough!)

**Reactive Work (40%):**
- Block 1: 90 min
- Block 2: 90 min
- Wrap-up: 30 min
- Total: 210 min (44%)

**Breaks/Lunch:**
- Breaks: 15 min
- Lunch: 60 min
- Total: 75 min (15%)

**Result:**
- You get 3.5 hours of DEEP WORK (undisturbed, high-quality)
- You get 3.5 hours of REACTIVE WORK (available, responsive)
- You get 1.25 hours of BREAKS (recover, recharge)
- You go home ON TIME with work DONE

**Compare to Current:**
- Current: 8+ hours of constant task-switching = 4 hours of actual productivity
- New System: 3.5 hours deep + 3.5 hours reactive = 7 hours of actual productivity
- **You get 75% MORE done in LESS time**

---

## STRESS MANAGEMENT: THE 3-3-3 METHOD

### WHEN YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED (Use This Immediately)

**The 3-3-3 Technique:**

**SEE 3 Things Around You**
- Look up from your desk
- Name 3 things you can see (window, plant, pen)
- Describe them in detail (blue pen, green plant, frosted window)
- **This pulls you out of stress spiral into present moment**

**FEEL 3 Things**
- Notice 3 physical sensations (feet on floor, hands on desk, back against chair)
- Press your feet into ground, feel the solid support
- **This grounds you in your body, stops panic**

**BREATHE 3 Times (Slowly)**
- Inhale 4 seconds (count: 1-2-3-4)
- Hold 4 seconds
- Exhale 4 seconds
- Repeat 3 times
- **This activates calm nervous system, shuts off stress response**

**Total Time: 2 minutes**
**Result: Stress drops 50%, clarity returns, you can think again**

**Use it:**
- Before difficult meeting
- After angry phone call
- When you want to cry/scream/quit
- End of stressful day before going home (don't bring work stress home)

---

## EMAIL MANAGEMENT: STOP DROWNING IN YOUR INBOX

### THE PROBLEM: Email Controls Your Day

**Sound Familiar?**
- Email open all day, ding every 3 minutes
- Interrupt deep work to answer "quick question"
- End of day: 50+ unread emails
- Anxiety: "What am I missing?"

**The Truth:**
- Average office worker checks email 36× per day
- Each interruption = 23 minutes to refocus
- You're spending 3-4 hours/day just SWITCHING between email and work
- **Email is not your job - it's a tool FOR your job**

---

### THE SOLUTION: Batch Processing

**New Email Rules:**

**1. Check Email 3× Per Day ONLY**
- 10:00 AM (during reactive block)
- 1:30 PM (during reactive block)
- 4:00 PM (during wrap-up)
- **That's it. No other times.**

**2. Close Email Outside Those Times**
- Literally close the program/tab
- Turn off notifications (ding = cortisol = stress)
- If urgent, people will call or walk over

**3. Process Email in Batches (30 min max)**
- Skim all, handle in order of importance
- Use 4-folder system:
  - **DO** (requires action from you - move to calendar/to-do list)
  - **DELEGATE** (forward with clear request)
  - **DECIDE LATER** (needs thought - schedule time to decide)
  - **DONE** (archive, you're finished)
- Goal: Every email gets ONE touch (read, decide, move on)

**4. Use Templates for Common Emails**
- "Here's the budget timeline" (you send this 20× per year - save template)
- "Meeting minutes attached" (template)
- "Request for public records" (template with legal language)
- **Saves 10-15 min per email**

**Result:**
- Inbox zero by end of each batch (massive stress relief)
- 90 min/day on email vs. 3-4 hours
- You control email, email doesn't control you

---

## MEETING MANAGEMENT: STOP WASTING TIME

### THE PROBLEM: Meetings Eat Your Life

**Your Reality:**
- Borough assembly meetings (long, political, draining)
- Staff meetings (could've been an email)
- Budget meetings (necessary but endless)
- "Quick sync" meetings (never quick)

**The Cost:**
- 10 meetings/week × 1 hour each = 10 hours (25% of your work week)
- Add prep time + follow-up = 15 hours (37% of your week)
- **You have 23 hours left for actual work**

---

### THE SOLUTION: Ruthless Meeting Rules

**1. Every Meeting Needs:**
- **Clear purpose** (Why are we meeting? What do we need to decide?)
- **Agenda** (sent 24 hours before)
- **Time limit** (30 min, 45 min, 60 min MAX - never "open-ended")
- **Action items** (who's doing what by when)

**If no agenda, decline the meeting.**

**2. Crystal's Meeting Rules:**

**Accept:**
- Borough assembly meetings (required)
- 1-on-1 with your boss (critical for your job)
- Budget/compliance meetings (legal requirement)

**Decline/Delegate:**
- Meetings where you're not essential (send someone else or ask for notes)
- "FYI" meetings (ask for email summary instead)
- Meetings with no agenda (reply: "Happy to attend once we have agenda")

**Shorten:**
- "1-hour meeting" → Can this be 30 min?
- "Weekly meeting" → Can this be every other week?
- "In-person meeting" → Can this be a phone call?

**3. Control Meetings You Run:**

**Start on time, end on time**
- Start at :00 or :30 (9:00, 9:30, not 9:17)
- Set timer on phone
- At time limit: "We're at time. Here's what we decided. Next steps are X, Y, Z. Thanks everyone."

**Stick to agenda**
- Off-topic discussion? "That's important, let's schedule separate time for that."
- One person dominating? "Thanks, John. Let's hear from others."

**End with action items**
- "Sarah will send budget draft by Friday."
- "Mike will call contractor by Wednesday."
- "Crystal will update the form and email by Monday."
- Everyone knows their job = no confusion, no follow-up meetings

**Result:**
- Meetings drop from 15 hrs/week to 8 hrs/week (save 7 hours!)
- Meetings you DO attend are productive
- You're seen as efficient, professional

---

## WORK-LIFE BALANCE: LEAVE WORK AT WORK

### THE PROBLEM: You Never Clock Out

**Your Current Evening:**
- Leave office physically, but mentally still working
- Check emails after dinner (just in case)
- Think about tomorrow's meeting while trying to sleep
- Wake up at 2 AM remembering thing you forgot to do
- **You're "on" 24/7**

**The Cost:**
- No recovery = burnout
- Snapping at family (they don't deserve your work stress)
- No hobbies, no fun, no YOU
- Health issues (stress = weight gain, insomnia, high blood pressure)

---

### THE SOLUTION: Hard Boundaries

**1. Physical Boundary: Leave Work Stuff at Work**
- No work laptop at home (unless pre-planned project night)
- No work email on personal phone (if you must, delete app on weekends)
- Work badge stays in work bag (visual cue: work is over)

**2. Time Boundary: Set "Office Hours"**
- Work exists 8 AM - 4:30 PM, Mon-Fri
- Outside those hours, you're OFF
- Emergencies? They can call your cell (real emergencies are rare)
- Non-emergencies? They can email, you'll respond tomorrow

**Exception:** Borough assembly meetings at night = part of job, but that's ONE evening, not EVERY evening

**3. Mental Boundary: End-of-Day Ritual**

**Before Leaving Office (5 min):**
- Write tomorrow's top 3 priorities on sticky note
- Clear desk (put papers in folders, close computer)
- Say out loud: "Work is done for today. Tomorrow's work is tomorrow's problem."
- **This signals to brain: SHIFT MODES**

**Commute Home (Even if it's short):**
- Listen to music (not news/work podcasts - something fun)
- Call a friend/family member (social, not work talk)
- Notice 3 things on drive (trees, sky, funny sign - gets you present)

**Walk in Front Door:**
- Change clothes immediately (work clothes = work mode, home clothes = home mode)
- Greet family: HUG, make eye contact, be THERE
- Ask them about THEIR day (shift focus off you/work)

**Result:**
- Work stress stays at work
- You're present at home (family feels it, you feel it)
- Sleep better (brain isn't churning on work problems)
- You actually RECOVER (so tomorrow you can work well again)

---

## SAYING "NO" WITHOUT FEELING GUILTY

### THE PROBLEM: You Say "Yes" to Everything

**Why You Do It:**
- You're helpful (it's your nature)
- You're good at your job (people know you'll do it right)
- You don't want to disappoint people
- You worry: "If I don't do it, who will?"

**What Happens:**
- Your to-do list explodes
- You stay late, skip lunch, work weekends
- Your actual job (the important stuff) gets pushed aside
- You're exhausted, resentful, burned out

**The Truth:**
- **Every "yes" to someone else is a "no" to yourself (your time, energy, priorities)**
- You can't do everything
- Trying to do everything = doing nothing well

---

### THE SOLUTION: Strategic "No"

**The Scripts (Use These Exactly):**

**1. "I'd love to help, but I'm at capacity right now."**
- Honest, professional, no elaboration needed
- Use for: Extra projects, volunteer requests, non-essential meetings

**2. "That's not in my wheelhouse. Have you tried [person/department]?"**
- Redirect to appropriate person
- Use for: Requests outside your role

**3. "I can do X, but not Y. Which matters more?"**
- Offer alternative, let them choose
- Use for: When you want to help but can't do it all
- Example: "I can review the budget OR attend the meeting, but not both this week. Which is priority?"

**4. "Not right now, but I can help next week."**
- Delay, not decline
- Gives you control over timing
- Use for: Legitimate requests that can wait

**5. "Let me check my workload and get back to you."**
- Buys time to think
- Prevents instant "yes" you'll regret
- Check your calendar, check with boss, then decide

**Practice:**
- Say these OUT LOUD in car/shower
- First few times will feel HARD (guilt, fear of judgment)
- After 3-5 times, it gets easier
- After 20 times, it's automatic

**What Happens:**
- People respect your boundaries
- They ask less (because they know you'll say no if you need to)
- When you DO say yes, they know you mean it
- **You protect your time = you do better work = you're more valuable**

---

## MANAGING DIFFICULT PEOPLE (Without Losing Your Mind)

### THE PROBLEM: People Are Stressful

**Your Reality:**
- Angry residents (taxes, permits, complaints)
- Demanding elected officials (want things NOW)
- Passive-aggressive coworkers (undermine, don't help)
- Know-it-alls (explain your job to you)

**What You Want to Say:**
- "Figure it out yourself."
- "That's not my problem."
- "You're being unreasonable."

**What You CAN'T Say** (because professionalism)

---

### THE SOLUTION: The 3-Step De-Escalation Method

**Step 1: ACKNOWLEDGE (Show You Heard Them)**
- "I hear that you're frustrated about X."
- "I understand this is important to you."
- "That sounds really challenging."
- **NOT agreeing, just reflecting**

**Why It Works:**
- People want to be HEARD
- Once they feel heard, they calm down 50%
- You're not solving yet, just listening

**Step 2: CLARIFY (Get Facts, Not Emotion)**
- "Let me make sure I understand. You're saying X?"
- "What specifically needs to happen to resolve this?"
- "When did this issue start?"
- **Ask questions, gather info**

**Why It Works:**
- Shifts from emotion to problem-solving
- You take control of conversation (calm, professional)
- Often they realize issue is smaller than they thought

**Step 3: SOLVE (Offer Next Step)**
- "Here's what I can do: X."
- "I'll look into this and get back to you by [date]."
- "That requires [boss/council/state], so here's the process..."
- **Be clear about what you CAN and CAN'T do**

**Why It Works:**
- Gives them hope (you're helping)
- Sets expectations (prevents "Why haven't you fixed this yet?!")
- Ends conversation productively

---

### EXAMPLE: ANGRY RESIDENT CALL

**Them:** "I've called FIVE TIMES about this permit and NO ONE has called me back! This is ridiculous!"

**You (Step 1 - Acknowledge):** "I hear how frustrating that must be. I'm sorry you haven't gotten a response."

**Them:** (Still mad but slightly calmer) "Yeah, I need this permit to start my project!"

**You (Step 2 - Clarify):** "Let me pull up your file. Can you give me your name and the permit number?"

**Them:** "John Smith, permit #12345."

**You:** (Looking it up) "Okay, I see here it was submitted last week. The delay is because we're waiting on the state fire marshal approval. That typically takes 10 business days."

**Them:** "Well no one TOLD me that!"

**You (Step 3 - Solve):** "You're right, we should have communicated that better. Here's what I'll do: I'll email you today with the timeline and the fire marshal's contact info so you can follow up directly. I'll also flag this for our weekly status meeting. Can I reach you at the phone number on file?"

**Them:** "Uh, yeah. Okay. Thanks."

**Result:**
- Angry person → Calm person in 3 minutes
- You didn't promise miracles (you can't control state fire marshal)
- You gave them ACTION (email, timeline, contact info)
- You protected yourself (documented what you did)
- You stayed CALM (no stress, no taking it personally)

---

## ENERGY MANAGEMENT: STOP RUNNING ON EMPTY

### THE PROBLEM: You're Exhausted All the Time

**Your Day:**
- Wake up tired (poor sleep)
- Coffee to function
- More coffee mid-morning
- Energy crash at 2 PM (eat candy to survive)
- Drag yourself through afternoon
- Too tired to cook/exercise/enjoy evening
- Collapse in bed, doom-scroll on phone
- Can't fall asleep (brain won't shut off)
- Repeat

**This Is Not Sustainable**

---

### THE SOLUTION: Energy Optimization

**1. SLEEP: Non-Negotiable 7-8 Hours**

**Why It Matters:**
- Sleep = when your brain recharges
- Less than 7 hours = impaired judgment (same as being drunk)
- Chronic poor sleep = weight gain, illness, depression

**How to Get Better Sleep:**
- **Same bedtime every night** (yes, even weekends) - 10:30 PM
- **No screens 1 hour before bed** (blue light kills melatonin = can't fall asleep)
- **Room: Cool, Dark, Quiet**
  - 65-68°F (Alaska winters = easy!)
  - Blackout curtains (especially summer when sun barely sets)
  - White noise machine OR fan
- **Wind-Down Routine** (tells brain: time to sleep)
  - 9:30 PM: Put phone on charger IN DIFFERENT ROOM (critical!)
  - 10:00 PM: Shower, skincare, comfy clothes
  - 10:15 PM: Read (fiction, not work stuff)
  - 10:30 PM: Lights out

**If You Can't Fall Asleep:**
- Don't force it (lying there stressed makes it worse)
- Get up, read for 20 min, try again
- 3-3-3 breathing (from earlier)
- No phone! (scroll = wake up brain)

---

**2. FOOD: Eat for Energy, Not Just Convenience**

**Your Current Diet** (Guess):
- Skip breakfast OR grab muffin/donut
- Snack on candy/chips at desk
- Lunch = whatever's fast (sandwich, leftover pizza)
- Dinner = exhausted, order takeout or cereal
- **Result: Blood sugar roller coaster = energy crash = more stress**

**Better Approach:**

**Breakfast (20 min prep):**
- Protein + Complex carbs
- Examples: Eggs + toast, Greek yogurt + granola, oatmeal + peanut butter
- **NOT:** Just coffee, sugary cereal, pastry
- **Why:** Stabilizes blood sugar, keeps you full until lunch

**Mid-Morning Snack** (if needed):
- Apple + cheese, nuts, protein bar
- **NOT:** Candy, chips, soda

**Lunch (Meal Prep on Sunday):**
- Make 5 lunches, store in fridge, grab-and-go
- Formula: Protein (chicken, turkey, beans) + Veggie + Carb (rice, quinoa, bread)
- Example: Turkey wrap with veggies, side of fruit
- **Eat AWAY from desk** (even 15 min break = mental reset)

**Afternoon Snack:**
- When 2 PM crash hits: Protein, not sugar
- Handful of almonds, string cheese, hard-boiled egg
- **NOT:** Candy bar (crashes you harder in 30 min)

**Dinner:**
- Simple = sustainable
- Rotate 3-5 easy meals (spaghetti, tacos, stir-fry, grilled chicken + veggies, chili)
- Cook once, eat leftovers 2× (less work!)

**Hydration:**
- 64+ oz water/day
- Keep water bottle at desk, refill 3× (morning, lunch, afternoon)
- Dehydration = fatigue, brain fog, stress

---

**3. MOVEMENT: You Don't Need a Gym**

**You Probably Think:**
- "I don't have time to exercise"
- "I'm too tired after work"
- "I hate the gym"

**Good News: You Don't Need an Hour at the Gym**

**Micro-Movements Throughout Day:**
- **Morning:** 10-min walk (around neighborhood, even in winter = wake up body)
- **Lunch:** Walk outside (even 10 min = reduces stress, improves focus)
- **Afternoon:** Desk stretches (stand up every hour, stretch arms/back/neck)
- **Evening:** 20-min easy movement (yoga video on YouTube, dance to music, walk dog)

**Total: 40 min/day, broken up = DOABLE**

**Benefits:**
- Reduces stress (movement burns cortisol)
- Improves sleep (tired body = easier to fall asleep)
- Boosts mood (endorphins = natural antidepressant)
- Prevents burnout (physical outlet for mental stress)

**Alaska Bonus:**
- Winter darkness = hard, so prioritize lunch walk (only daylight you'll get)
- Summer midnight sun = evening walks are magical

## FINAL WORDS: YOU'RE DOING BETTER THAN YOU THINK

Crystal,

You are a Borough Clerk in ALASKA.

Do you know how hard that job is?

Small team. Big responsibilities. Isolated location. Long winters. Political drama. Budget constraints. Everyone wants something from you.

And you're STILL SHOWING UP.

That's not weakness. That's STRENGTH.

**This guide isn't about fixing you.**
**You're not broken.**

This guide is about giving you TOOLS so the hard job feels less hard.

60/40 schedule = you control your day (instead of chaos controlling you)

3-3-3 breathing = you calm yourself in 2 minutes (instead of spiraling)

Saying "no" = you protect your time (instead of drowning in other people's requests)

Sleep + food + movement = you have ENERGY (instead of running on fumes)

---

**You don't need to do ALL of this tomorrow.**

Pick ONE thing.

Try it for a week.

See if it helps.

Then add one more.

Small changes = big results over time.

---

**You've got this.**

And when it feels like you don't?

Read this guide again.

Because the strategies are here.

The tools are here.

The support is here.

**You just have to use them.**

---

**From someone who believes in you,**
**Shannon**

---

P.S. - The 60/40 rule? That's actually based on a mathematical pattern found in nature (the golden ratio). But you don't need to know the science. You just need to know IT WORKS. Because nature figured out optimal balance millions of years before we did. We're just copying the blueprint.

---

**NOW GO HAVE A LESS STRESSFUL WEEK. 💪**
