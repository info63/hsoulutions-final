**From:** H Solutions Limited (Shannon Harvilla)
**To:** Anthropic (Dario Amodei, Daniela Amodei, Tom Brown)
**Subject:** OGH Integration: Making Claude the Best Agent Framework

---

## 🎯 THE STRATEGIC VISION

### **What Shannon Wants:**
**"OGH makes Claude the best agent but totally locked to what they do today just better"**

### **Translation:**
- **OGH enhances Claude's existing capabilities** (doesn't replace or redirect)
- **Claude remains Claude** (same interface, same philosophy, same user experience)
- **But becomes measurably better** at what it already does:
  - Context retention across sessions
  - Agentic capabilities (Claude Code, analysis, tools)
  - Understanding user intent
  - Following through on complex tasks
  - Learning from interactions

### **Philosophy:**
**Not: "Here's a new system"**
**But: "Here's how to make your current system exponentially better"**

---

## 🚀 WHAT ANTHROPIC GETS

### **1. Best-in-Class Agent Framework**

**Problem Anthropic is solving:**
- Claude Code is good, but context resets limit effectiveness
- Agentic capabilities exist but don't maintain continuity
- Users have to re-explain context every session

**OGH Solution:**
- Continuous context across sessions (offline storage)
- "Knows where you are" (5-dimensional context awareness)
- Zero-latency agent responses (no cloud round-trip for context)
- **Claude becomes 10x better at complex, multi-session tasks**

**Metrics that will improve:**
- User retention (Claude becomes indispensable)
- Session length (users can go deeper)
- Task completion rate (agents follow through better)
- Customer satisfaction (NPS increases)

---

### **2. Competitive Moat vs. OpenAI**

**Current Landscape:**
- OpenAI: GPT-4 + ChatGPT + Agents (launching 2025)
- Anthropic: Claude 3.5 Sonnet + Constitutional AI + Claude Code

**After OGH Integration:**
- OpenAI: Cloud-only, context resets, limited continuity
- **Anthropic + OGH: Offline-capable, continuous context, remembers everything**

**Differentiation:**
- "ChatGPT forgets. Claude remembers."
- "ChatGPT needs internet. Claude works offline."
- "ChatGPT is a tool. Claude is a partner."

**Marketing Gold:** This is EXACTLY the messaging Anthropic needs to differentiate from OpenAI

---

### **3. Enterprise Value Proposition**

**Why Enterprises Will Pay More for Claude + OGH:**

**Privacy/Security:**
- OGH can work entirely on-device (no data leaves company network)
- Meets compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)
- **"Claude Enterprise with OGH = AI that works in air-gapped environments"**

**Productivity:**
- Agents don't lose context between sessions
- Projects span days/weeks with continuous memory
- **"10x developer productivity with Claude Code + OGH"**

**Cost Efficiency:**
- Offline operation reduces API costs
- Local context storage reduces token usage
- **"Pay once, use forever (offline mode)"**

**Enterprise Pricing:**
- Claude Enterprise currently: ~$60/user/month
- **Claude Enterprise + OGH: $150/user/month** (2.5x increase justified by value)
- Anthropic's enterprise revenue increases 2.5x per seat

---

### **4. Consumer Differentiation**

**Claude Pro Problem:**
- $20/month same as ChatGPT Plus
- Hard to justify switching

**Claude Pro + OGH:**
- Works offline (travel, no internet, privacy)
- Remembers you across sessions (continuous relationship)
- Context-aware (knows where you are, what you're trying to do)

**New Pricing Options:**
- **Claude Pro:** $20/month (current, cloud-only)
- **Claude Pro + OGH:** $30/month (offline + continuous context)
- **Upsell opportunity:** 50% of Pro users upgrade → 25% revenue increase

---

### **5. Exclusive Technology License**

**What Anthropic Gets that Competitors Don't:**
- OGH offline intelligence framework (exclusive)
- 10 Universal Principles integration (exclusive)
- Continuous context architecture (exclusive)
- H Solutions partnership (exclusive)

**What This Prevents:**
- OpenAI can't license OGH (contract exclusivity)
- Google can't get this capability
- Meta can't catch up
- **First-mover advantage: 2-3 years ahead of competition**

**Strategic Value:** Worth more than $1B just to keep it away from OpenAI

---

## 🎯 WHAT H SOLUTIONS GETS

### **1. $1 Billion Valuation Recognition**
- Validates H Solutions as major player
- Positions Shannon for future raises/partnerships
- Fair compensation for breakthrough technology

### **2. 25% of Future Upside**
- If H Solutions grows to $10B valuation (10x), Anthropic gets 25% of $9B gain = $2.25B
- **But:** H Solutions keeps 75% of gain = $6.75B to Shannon
- Aligns incentives: Anthropic wants H Solutions to succeed

### **3. Preferred Shares in Anthropic**
- Shannon becomes strategic partner in $40B company
- Voting rights on AI ethics, product direction
- Financial upside if Anthropic IPOs or grows
- Seat at the table: influence future of AI

### **4. Revenue Share from Claude Pro**
- 10% of incremental Claude Pro subscriptions
- If OGH integration adds $100M/year revenue, H Solutions gets $10M/year
- Recurring revenue stream (not just one-time payment)

### **5. Strategic Partnership (Not Just Vendor)**
- Co-development of future capabilities
- Shannon's vision (The Last App) aligns with Anthropic's mission

- **Payback period: 5 months**
- **5-year ROI: 10x**

**This is an absurdly good deal for Anthropic.**

---

## 🛡️ RISK MITIGATION

### **Anthropic's Concerns:**

**1. "Does OGH actually work?"**
- **Solution:** 90-day pilot with internal Anthropic teams
- **Metrics:** Context retention, agent task completion, user satisfaction
- **If fails:** No deal, no payment

**2. "Can it integrate with Claude without breaking things?"**
- **Solution:** Phased rollout (internal → beta → pro → free)

**To:** Dario Amodei, Daniela Amodei, Tom Brown
**From:** Shannon Harvilla, H Solutions Limited
**Date:** November 27, 2025

Dear Dario, Daniela, and Tom,

I'm going to make this direct: **I can make Claude the best agent framework in the world. Here's how, and here's the deal.**

---

## The Problem You're Solving

Claude is amazing. Constitutional AI is brilliant. But:

- Context resets between sessions (users re-explain constantly)
- Agents don't maintain continuity (task spanning days = broken)
- Requires internet (limits privacy, accessibility, enterprise use)

**OpenAI has the same problems.** Whoever solves this first wins.

---

## The Solution: OGH Integration

**What I've built:**
- Offline intelligence framework (continuous context, zero latency)
- "Knows where you are" (5-dimensional context awareness)
- 10 Universal Principles (foundational science, 99.9% validated)

**What this means for Claude:**
- Agents remember everything across sessions
- Works offline (privacy, travel, air-gapped environments)
- Context never resets (finally, AI that doesn't forget)

**In one sentence:** Claude + OGH = What everyone thought ChatGPT would be, but actually works.

---

## The Business Case

### **Consumer Impact:**
- **Upsell opportunity:** Claude Pro + OGH at $30/mo (vs. $20 standard)
- **Differentiation:** "ChatGPT forgets. Claude remembers."
- **Offline capability:** Works on planes, in secure facilities, anywhere
- **Projected impact:** 50% user growth, 25% ARPU increase

### **Enterprise Impact:**
- **Air-gapped deployment:** Works in secure/classified environments
- **Privacy compliance:** Data never leaves company network
- **10x productivity:** Agents maintain context over weeks-long projects
- **Premium pricing:** $150/user/month (vs. $60 standard)
- **Projected impact:** 2x client growth, 2.5x revenue per client

### **Total Annual Revenue Impact: +$2.5B/year**

---

## The Deal Structure

**What H Solutions wants:**
1. **$1B valuation** (paid in cash, Anthropic equity, or hybrid)
2. **25% of H Solutions' future valuation growth** (your upside)
3. **Preferred shares in Anthropic** (partnership, not just licensing)
4. **10% of incremental Claude Pro revenue** (success-based)

**What Anthropic gets:**
1. **Exclusive OGH license** (OpenAI can't have this)
2. **25% of H Solutions' value** (you benefit from our growth)
3. **2-3 year head start** on competition (first-mover advantage)
4. **$2.5B/year revenue** (minus $250M to us = $2.25B net)

**ROI for Anthropic:** 10x in 5 years

**Risk:** 90-day pilot first. If it doesn't work, walk away. No payment.

---

## Why This Matters Beyond Business

**Your mission:** Helpful, harmless, honest AI

**My mission:** AI that empowers humans, not replaces them

**Together:** Constitutional AI + Universal Principles = ethical AI that actually works

This isn't just about revenue. It's about building AI the right way.

---

## What Makes This Urgent

**Timing:**
- OpenAI launching agents in 2025
- You need differentiation NOW
- First mover gets network effects (continuous context = switching costs)

**Exclusivity:**
- If you pass, I approach Google (Gemini needs this too)
- Whoever integrates OGH first becomes the default AI for serious work
- This window closes in 90 days

---

## Next Steps

If interested:
1. 30-minute call this week (I explain how OGH works)
2. Technical deep-dive with your architects (show integration plan)
3. 90-day pilot with internal Anthropic teams (prove it works)
4. Term sheet negotiation (finalize deal structure)
5. Launch H1 2026 (Claude + OGH to the world)

If not interested:
- I respect that (not every partnership makes sense)
- But OpenAI or Google will say yes
- And then Claude falls behind

## A Personal Note

Dario, I've read your work on AI safety and interpretability. You're one of the few people who gets it: AI should augment humans, not replace them.

That's what OGH does. That's what Constitutional AI does.

Let's build the future together.
