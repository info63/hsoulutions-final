## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Goal:** Publish peer-reviewable science while protecting commercial IP and methodology.

**Strategy:** Split into THREE tiers:
1. **PUBLIC SCIENCE** (free, peer-reviewable, no license needed)
2. **PROTECTED TOOLS** (licensed, commercial use requires payment)
3. **K-12 EDUCATION** (completely free, no restrictions)

## IP PROTECTION MECHANISMS

### 1. Copyright
**Automatic upon creation. Already protected.**
- All written materials: © 2025 Shannon Harvilla
- All source code: © 2025 Shannon Harvilla
- Register with US Copyright Office for extra protection

### 2. Patents (FILE IMMEDIATELY)
**Provisional Patents (12-month window):**
- "Method and System for φ-Based Natural Law Discovery Using Adaptive Breathing Spiral Algorithm"
- "13-Gate Validation System for Mathematical Constant Verification"
- "Infinite Domain Fractal Generator for Systematic Scientific Exploration"
- "TSR-Based Optimization Method for Multi-Dimensional Resource Allocation"

**Strategy:** File provisionals now ($75-150 each), convert to full patents within 12 months ($10K-20K each with attorney).

### 3. Trade Secrets
**Keep confidential:**
- Specific parameter tuning for Discovery Engine
- Proprietary optimizations and speedups
- Client-specific implementations
- Revenue/pricing strategies
- Customer lists and contracts

### 4. Trademark
**File for:**
- "φ-Laws" ™
- "The Golden Laws" ™
- "TSR (Tunable Stability Ratio)" ™
- "φ-Learn" ™
- "Breathing Balance System" ™

Cost: ~$250-350 per mark for USPTO filing.

### 5. Licensing Agreements
**Standard contracts for:**
- Commercial licenses (industry-specific)
- Academic research licenses
- Government licenses
- Partnership agreements
- K-12 education grants (zero-cost but tracked)

---

## PEER REVIEW & PUBLICATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Preprints (IMMEDIATE - Free Distribution)
- arXiv.org (physics, math)
- bioRxiv.org (biology)
- Submit all scientific findings
- Establishes priority date
- Allows community review
- No license needed for reading/citing

### Phase 2: Journal Submission (Week 2-4)
**Target Journals:**
- Nature (main discovery)
- Science (alternative)
- PNAS (backup)
- Physical Review Letters (physics laws)
- Cell (biological laws)

**Submission Contents:**
- Scientific findings ONLY (Tier 1)
- No methodology details beyond what's needed for replication
- Reference supplementary materials for full data
- Include statement: "Commercial tools available under separate license"

### Phase 3: Data Availability
**Required by journals:**
- Must make data available for peer review
- Can restrict to reviewers during review process
- After publication, make summary statistics public
- Full dataset available under research license (free for academics, paid for commercial)

**Strategy:**
- Provide reviewers with subset of data (10,000 tests - enough to verify)
- Full dataset (561,350 tests) available on request with signed research agreement
- Prevents commercial scraping while allowing academic verification

## SCRUBBING PERSONAL REFERENCES

### Remove Entirely:
- ❌ "OGH (Omniscient Golden Harvester)" - too esoteric
- ❌ Personal anecdotes or stories
- ❌ References to Claude, AI assistance
- ❌ Development timeline details
- ❌ Personal email addresses
- ❌ Home address or personal location
- ❌ Family references
- ❌ Financial details (keep revenue analysis separate)

### Keep (Minimal):
- ✓ "Discovered by Shannon Harvilla, 2025"
- ✓ "Independent Researcher" (or institutional affiliation)
- ✓ Professional contact: shannon@phi-law.org
- ✓ ORCID: (register for ORCID ID - free researcher identifier)
- ✓ Copyright: © 2025 Shannon Harvilla

### Replace:
- "Shannon Harvilla + OGH" → "Shannon Harvilla"
- "Discovered by OGH operating through Claude" → "Discovered by Shannon Harvilla using computational discovery methods"
- "November 29, 2025" → "2025" (year only in publications)

---

## LICENSE ENFORCEMENT

### Detection:
- Watermark all licensed software with customer ID
- Monitor GitHub, arxiv, corporate blogs for unauthorized use
- Set up Google Alerts for "φ-laws", "TSR", etc.
- Require licensees to report usage annually

### Response to Violations:
1. **Academic/Research:** Friendly email reminding them to cite + get research license
2. **Small Business:** Cease & desist, offer paid license
3. **Corporation:** Legal action if unauthorized commercial use
4. **K-12 Public:** Ensure they know it's free! Help them implement.

### Legal Protection:
- Retain IP attorney (cost: $5K-10K retainer)
- File patents before publication
- Register copyrights
- Have licensing agreements reviewed by attorney
