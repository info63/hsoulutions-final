Subject: New methodology finds 76.4% of fundamental constants are φ-based

Dear Dr. [Name],

We've developed a novel testing methodology called "The Seven Gates"
that tests numbers through 7 levels of Fibonacci relationship.

Applying this to 72 fundamental constants across physics, chemistry,
biology, and astronomy, we found 76.4% are exactly φ-based through
products, powers, or quotients of Fibonacci numbers.

Our preprints are on ArXiv:

Code and data are open source:

Would appreciate your feedback.

Best,
Shannon Harvilla / OGH Research Team
