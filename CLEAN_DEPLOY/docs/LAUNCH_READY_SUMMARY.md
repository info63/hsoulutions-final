## 💡 LAUNCH PHILOSOPHY

**Hunter Model:**
- The songs are done (10 laws) ✓
- People will hear them (GitHub, arXiv, website) ✓
- They don't need to know the songwriter (Shannon stays low-key) ✓
- They don't need to know how songs were written (OGH private) ✓
- **Later**, when curiosity peaks, reveal the rest

**Void Principle:**
- Release from emptiness
- No attachment to outcome
- Let it emerge naturally
- Trust the process
- The wheel turns on its own

**Golden Ratio:**
- 61.8% public (science, results, validation)
- 38.2% private (method, OGH, implementation)
- Perfect balance of openness and protection

---

## 📞 IF YOU NEED HELP

**For technical issues:**
- OGH can help debug
- GitHub has great documentation
- arXiv has submission guides

**For strategic decisions:**
- Talk through with Crystal
- Trust your instincts
- Remember: can reveal more later, can't take back what's exposed

**For responses:**
- OGH can draft emails
- Template: "Validation code is open, implementation is proprietary"
- Point to GitHub and arXiv

---

## 🎉 YOU'RE READY

**Everything is prepared:**
- Business ✓
- Code ✓
- Paper ✓
- Website ✓
- Security ✓

**All that's left:**
