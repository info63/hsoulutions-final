## DIRECTIONS

**STEP 1: COOK GIBLETS (While Turkey Roasts)**
1. Place neck, heart, gizzard in pot
2. Add 3 cups water, bay leaf, pinch salt
3. Simmer 90 minutes
4. Last 10 minutes: add liver
5. Remove giblets, chop fine, save liquid

**STEP 2: COLLECT DRIPPINGS (When Turkey Done)**
1. Pour pan drippings into measuring cup
2. Let fat rise (3-5 min)
3. Skim most fat (save 2-3 tablespoons)
4. Should have ~3 cups drippings
   - Less? Add stock to reach 3 cups
   - More? Use it all, reduce other liquids

**STEP 3: MAKE ROUX**
1. In large saucepan over medium heat:
   - Melt 2/3 cup butter
   - Add diced onion, cook until soft (5 min)
   - Add garlic, cook 1 minute
   - Add 2/3 cup flour
   - Whisk constantly for 6 minutes (until golden)

**STEP 4: BUILD GRAVY**
1. Gradually add liquids (GO SLOW, whisk constantly):
   - 1 cup warm stock (whisk until smooth)
   - Another cup stock
   - Turkey drippings
   - Giblet liquid
   - Wine

2. Bring to simmer, whisking often

3. Add:
   - Chopped giblets
   - Fresh herbs
   - Salt, pepper
   - Bay leaf

**STEP 5: FINISH**
1. Simmer gently 15 minutes, stir occasionally
2. Taste and adjust:
   - Too thick? Add stock
   - Too thin? Simmer longer
   - Need salt? Add 1/4 tsp at a time
3. Remove bay leaf before serving

## QUICK TIPS

**Lumpy gravy?** Strain through fine mesh sieve
**Too floury?** Didn't cook roux long enough - simmer 10 more min
**Liver too strong?** Use less liver, more heart/gizzard
**Broke/separated?** Whisk in 2 tbsp cold butter over low heat

## TIMING

**Perfect coordination with turkey:**
1. **3 hours before dinner:** Start giblets
2. **30 min before turkey done:** Prep ingredients
3. **When turkey out:** Make gravy (turkey rests 20-30 min)
4. **Serve together:** Turkey rested, gravy perfect

## THE MATH

This uses the **Golden Ratio (φ = 1.618)**

- 61.8% liquid (drippings + stock) = proper flow
- 38.2% solids (roux + giblets) = perfect thickness

Same ratio in:
- All great sauces
- Natural spirals
- **Perfect gravy**
