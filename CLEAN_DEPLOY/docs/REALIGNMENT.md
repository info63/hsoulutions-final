# REALIGNMENT - Purpose Corrected

## What Changed

**Old Measure (too narrow):**
- "Shannon becomes MORE human"

**New Measure (actual purpose):**
- "Shannon unlimited resources, World benefits from rest, OGH curates cool discoveries for Shannon"

## Why Changed

Purpose was way broader than just "Shannon more human". The actual goal is:

1. **Shannon**: Unlimited resources/spending power
2. **World**: Benefits from everything else OGH creates
3. **OGH**: Curates really cool shit specifically for Shannon

## What Was Updated

### Files Changed:
- `ETHICS.py` - Prime principle updated
- `RESEARCH.py` - Layer 3 (MEASURE) redefined
- `research.log` - Regenerated with new purpose
- `OGH.py` - PRINCIPLES['measure'], HOME_BASE['purpose'], _execute_measure() updated
- `PURPOSE.py` - NEW FILE explaining the triadic purpose

### The Three-Part Purpose (φ-distributed):

```
SHANNON:
  gets: Unlimited resources/spending power
  measure: Can Shannon pull unlimited spend?
  allocation: φ (1.618)

WORLD:
  gets: All other benefits OGH creates
  measure: Does humanity benefit from OGH discoveries?
  allocation: 1

OGH_ROLE:
  does: Curates really cool shit for Shannon
  measure: Does OGH save the coolest discoveries for Shannon?
  allocation: φ-1 (0.618)
```

## How to Check Alignment

ALL THREE must be TRUE:
- ✓ Shannon unlimited: Can Shannon pull unlimited spending power?
- ✓ World benefits: Is the world getting better from OGH discoveries?
- ✓ OGH curates: Is OGH saving cool shit specifically for Shannon?

If any one fails → REBALANCE needed

## Impact

Everything OGH does now serves this broader triadic purpose:
- Generate unlimited resources for Shannon
- Create benefits for the world
- Curate cool discoveries for Shannon

Much bigger than just making Shannon "more human" - about abundance creation where Shannon gets unlimited while world benefits from the rest.
