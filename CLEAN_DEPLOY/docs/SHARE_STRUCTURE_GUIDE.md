## Is This Good? Analysis

### ✅ GOOD THINGS:

1. **You Have Control**
   - 100% ownership = total control
   - Can't be outvoted
   - Make all decisions

2. **Two Classes of Stock**
   - Preferred = special rights (dividends, voting, liquidation preference)
   - Common = regular ownership
   - Gives you flexibility

3. **Plenty of Authorized Shares**
   - Can issue up to 100,000 more common shares
   - Room to add investors/partners
   - Don't need to amend articles to issue more

4. **All Shares Issued**
   - You own everything
   - No unissued shares floating around
   - Clean structure

### 🤔 POTENTIAL ISSUES:

1. **Par Value Seems Random**
   - Did you actually pay $1.1 million for these shares?
   - Par value = minimum price per share
   - If you didn't pay, there could be tax issues

2. **High Par Value = Tax Liability?**
   - If you issued yourself $1.1M in stock for free...
   - IRS might say you got $1.1M in income
   - Could owe taxes on phantom income

3. **Preferred vs Common**
   - What rights does preferred have?
   - Usually: higher dividends, liquidation preference
   - But you own both, so doesn't matter yet

### 💡 THE TRUTH:

**You probably just guessed at these numbers when filing, right?**

Most people do. Here's what likely happened:
- Form asked for par value
- You entered random numbers that seemed "businessy"
- Alaska accepted it
- Now you technically have $1.1M company on paper

**This is FINE for now** - you're sole owner, no actual money changed hands yet, no immediate problem.

**But if you want to sell/gift shares, need to get this cleaned up.**

## How to Sell Shares

### Option 1: Private Sale (To Specific Person)

**Steps:**
1. **Decide Price & Terms**
   - How much per share?
   - How many shares?
   - Cash, trade, services?

2. **Draft Stock Purchase Agreement**
   - Buyer agrees to purchase X shares for $Y
   - Terms of payment
   - Representations and warranties
   - Signatures

3. **Issue Stock Certificate**
   - Create certificate showing ownership
   - Sign as President/Secretary
   - Give to buyer

4. **Update Corporate Records**
   - Record transfer in stock ledger
   - Update shareholder list
   - File with Alaska? (only if changes officers/directors)

5. **Handle Taxes**
   - Buyer: no immediate tax (they bought asset)
   - You: capital gains tax on profit (if any)
   - Company: no tax (just ownership transfer)

**Example:**
- You sell 10,000 common shares to Crystal for $10,000 ($1/share)
- She now owns 10% of company (10,000 / 100,000)
- You still own 90% (90,000 common + 1,000 preferred)

---

### Option 2: Gift Shares (Free Transfer)

**Steps:**
1. **Decide Who Gets What**
   - Crystal: X shares
   - Liv: Y shares
   - Family: Z shares

2. **Execute Stock Transfer Form**
   - Transfer X shares from Shannon to Crystal
   - For $0 or "love and affection"

3. **Issue New Stock Certificates**

4. **Update Corporate Records**

5. **Handle Taxes**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Gifting shares = gift tax rules
   - You can gift $18,000/person/year tax-free (2024 limit)
   - If shares worth more, you file gift tax return
   - But you have $13.61M lifetime exemption
   - So probably no actual tax, just paperwork

**Example:**
- Gift 30,000 common shares to Crystal (30%)
- Gift 10,000 common shares to Liv (10%)
- You keep 60,000 common + 1,000 preferred (60%+)
- File gift tax return if needed

---

### Option 3: Employee/Advisor Stock Options

**For future contributors to OGH project:**

1. **Create Stock Option Plan**
   - Reserve X shares for options
   - Set vesting schedule (earn over time)
   - Set strike price (exercise price)

2. **Grant Options to Contributors**
   - "You can buy 1,000 shares at $1/share"
   - But you must work for 2 years to earn them
   - If you quit early, lose unvested options

3. **They Exercise When Ready**
   - Pay strike price
   - Receive shares
   - Now shareholders

**Good for:** Attracting talent without paying cash now

---

### Option 4: Public Offering (Way Future)

**If company becomes huge:**
- Register with SEC
- List on stock exchange
- Anyone can buy shares
- Heavy regulation, reporting requirements

**Not relevant now, but keep in mind for way later.**

## How Par Value Works

### What is Par Value?

**Par Value** = Minimum legal price per share

When you issue shares, you must receive at least par value in exchange.

**Your Current Par Value:**
- Preferred: $100/share × 1,000 = $100,000
- Common: $10/share × 100,000 = $1,000,000
- **Total: $1,100,000**

### Did You Actually Pay This?

When you incorporated and issued shares to yourself, did you:
- Put $1.1M into company bank account? (Probably not)
- Transfer $1.1M in assets to company? (Probably not)
- Just click "issue shares" and move on? (Probably yes)

**If you didn't pay par value:**
- Shares are "not fully paid"
- Technically a liability
- Could have tax/legal issues

### How to Fix This

**Option A: Reduce Par Value (Amendment)**

File amendment with Alaska changing par value to $0.01 or $0.001

**New structure:**
- Preferred: $0.01/share × 1,000 = $10
- Common: $0.01/share × 100,000 = $1,000
- **Total: $1,010** (much more reasonable)

**Benefits:**
- More realistic
- Easier to justify
- Common in modern companies

**Steps:**
1. Draft Articles of Amendment
2. File with Alaska
3. Pay amendment fee (~$100)

---

**Option B: Document Contribution**

Create documentation that you contributed something worth $1.1M:
- Intellectual property (OGH system)
- Time/labor
- Future services

**Problems:**
- Hard to prove OGH worth $1.1M (no revenue yet)
- IRS might disagree
- Creates taxable event

---

**Option C: Do Nothing (For Now)**

Since you're sole owner and no actual sale happening:
- Nobody's checking
- No immediate harm
- Deal with it if/when you sell shares

**Risk:** If you sell shares later, buyer might question par value issue

## Recommended Structure for Your Situation

### Ideal Setup for Distributing to Loved Ones + Future DAO

**Phase 1: Fix Par Value**

File amendment reducing par value to $0.01/share:
- Makes 101,000 shares = $1,010 total par value
- Realistic, justifiable
- Common practice

**Phase 2: Current Distribution (φ Ratio)**

Using φ = 1.618:

**Shannon + Crystal + Liv: 61.8% of company**
- Shannon: 40,000 common shares (40%)
- Crystal: 13,000 common shares (13%)
- Liv: 8,800 common shares (8.8%)
- **Subtotal: 61,800 shares = 61.8%**

**World/Public Benefit: 23.6%**
- Reserve for future: 23,600 shares
- Could be:
  - Contributors to project
  - Community members
  - DAO token holders later
  - Public benefit programs

**OGH Curation: 14.6%**
- Reserve: 14,600 shares
- Shannon retains control of these
- Used for strategic decisions
- Keeps alignment with OGH vision

**Your 1,000 Preferred Shares:**
- Keep these
- Give them special voting rights
- Can't be diluted
- Maintain control even if common shares spread

## Important Tax Notes

### Gifting Shares:

**2024 Gift Tax Rules:**
- $18,000 per person per year = no paperwork
- Above that = file Form 709 (gift tax return)
- But you have $13.61M lifetime exemption
- So no actual tax, just disclosure

**Example:**
- If 13,000 shares worth $1/share = $13,000 gift to Crystal
- Under $18,000 limit = no paperwork needed

**Example 2:**
- If 13,000 shares worth $10/share = $130,000 gift
- Over limit = file Form 709
- But applies to lifetime exemption, no tax due

### Selling Shares:

**Capital Gains:**
- If you sell shares for more than you paid (basis)
- You owe capital gains tax on profit
- Your basis = $0 or par value or what you contributed
- Long-term rate (held >1 year): 15-20%

**Example:**
- You sell 10,000 shares for $50,000
- Your basis: $100 (10,000 × $0.01 par value)
- Gain: $49,900
- Tax: ~$7,485-9,980 (15-20% depending on income)

## Do You Need a Lawyer?

**For launching science: No**

**For gifting shares to family: No** (simple docs, no legal requirement)

**For selling shares to outsiders: Maybe**
- If small amount, private: probably no
- If raising capital, many investors: yes
- Securities laws apply

**For DAO conversion: Yes**
- Complex legal/regulatory issues
- Want to do it right
- ~$5k-20k in legal fees

---

## Bottom Line

**Your current structure:**
- Is FINE for now
- Was probably guessed (that's okay)
- Should be cleaned up before major distributions
- Totally workable for family gifts

**To gift shares to Crystal/Liv:**
1. Wait until after science launches
2. File amendment to fix par value
3. Execute simple transfer agreements
4. Done - they're shareholders

**Cost to do this right:**
- Amendment filing: ~$100
- Stock certificates: $0 (DIY)
- Gift tax filing: $0 (if under limit) or ~$200 (accountant)
- Total: ~$100-300

**Not urgent. Launch science first. Clean up corporate stuff in December/January.**
