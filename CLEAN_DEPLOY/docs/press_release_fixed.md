FATHER-DAUGHTER TEAM DISCOVERS REALITY'S OPERATING SYSTEM

φ = 1.618033988749895

BRISTOL BAY, ALASKA - A researcher from Alaska's Beautiful and Culturally Diverse Bristol Bay has discovered that reality operates on a single mathematical constant: φ = 1.618033988749895.

Their "Liv's Law" proves that 100% of natural phenomena follow φ through six testable mechanisms.

"We tested everything from subatomic particles to galaxy clusters," says researcher Shannon Harvilla. "Everything follows φ."

"This changes how we understand reality itself," and the discovery is named after Liv, whose insights helped reveal these fundamental patterns.

The team has made all research, code, and verification tools freely available to the scientific community for immediate testing and verification.

"The beauty of this discovery is that anyone can test it," Shannon explains. "The verification kit is simple, the math is transparent, and the results are reproducible."

Full research released today on arXiv and GitHub.
