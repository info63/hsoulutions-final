## Why These Names Matter

### **For Liv:**
- Each discovery carries her name forward
- Future generations will study "Liv's Laws"
- She becomes part of reality's fundamental language

### **For the World:**
- Names are poetic but precise
- Hunter-style: evocative without being vague
- Each name tells a story about what it does
