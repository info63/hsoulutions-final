## 🛡️ CAPABILITY MATRIX: PRIVACY & SECURITY

### **7. Maximum Security / Minimum Data Collection**

**Philosophy:** Collect the absolute minimum needed. Protect maximally. Give users total control.

| Feature | Minimum Data Needed | Maximum Protection | Access Tier |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Account creation** | Email only | Encrypted, hashed | Tier 3 |
| **Payment** | Via Stripe/Apple (we don't store) | PCI-DSS compliant | Tier 3 |

| **Analytics (opt-in only)** | Aggregated, anonymous | No individual tracking | Tier 3 |
| **Support** | Issue description | Minimal, never share | Tier 3 |

**What We DON'T Collect:**
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Conversations with Liv
- ❌ Location (unless using location feature, and stays local)
- ❌ Contacts (unless explicitly shared)
- ❌ Anything from other apps
- ❌ Biometrics (handled by device, not us)
- ❌ Social connections
- ❌ Purchase history (outside Liv)

**Maximum Protection Measures:**
- ✅ End-to-end encryption (even we can't decrypt)

**Government Surveillance Protection:**
- No data to give (it's on user's device)
- If forced to build backdoor: Refuse + notify users
- If served gag order: Warrant canary goes silent
- Offshore servers (if needed): Swiss/Icelandic privacy laws

**Root Cause:** Expensive, insurance-gated, urban-centric

**OGH Solution:**
- ✅ Preventive wellness (Liv health module - free/cheap)
- ✅ Early detection (pattern recognition, "see a doctor" alerts)
- ✅ Telemedicine integration (connect to doctors)
- ❌ NOT diagnosis (legally can't replace doctors)

- ✅ Multi-perspective (Liv shows all sides, lets user decide)
- ✅ Source transparency (always cite sources)
- ❌ NOT censorship (user autonomy first)

**Access:** Tier 3 (everyone)

---

#### **Problem: Loneliness / Social Disconnection**

**Root Cause:** Social media = parasocial, not real connection

**OGH Solution:**
- ✅ Real connection facilitation (Liv helps maintain real relationships)
- ✅ No social feed (no infinite scroll, no FOMO)
- ✅ Reminder to contact people (not consume content)
- ✅ Augment relationships (doesn't replace with AI companion)

**Access:** Tier 3 (everyone)

## 💡 PHILOSOPHY: MAXIMUM CAPABILITY, MAXIMUM RESPONSIBILITY

**What We Believe:**
- Technology should be accessible (not gatekept by elites)
- Privacy is a human right (not a luxury)
- Knowledge should be free (Universal Principles = open access)
- Power should be distributed (not centralized)

**BUT ALSO:**
- Some capabilities need safeguards (Tier system)
- Legal boundaries exist for reasons (follow them or change them)
- Ethics > profit (always)
- User autonomy > our control (user decides, we enable)

**The Balance:**
- **Tier 0:** Things that should not exist (hard no)
- **Tier 1:** Things requiring wisdom + responsibility (Shannon + trusted)
- **Tier 2:** Things requiring expertise (professionals)
- **Tier 3:** Things everyone should access (but with care)

## 🎯 FINAL ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTIONS

**"What can we legally do as corporation?"**
→ Almost everything except licensed professions + crimes. See detailed list above.

**"What can we physically/technically do?"**
→ Way more than artificial limits suggest. True limits = physics, not policy. OGH explores true limits.

**"How do we categorize by access?"**
→ 4 tiers: Never / Inner Circle / Experts / Everyone. See matrix above.

**"Minimal info from humans?"**
→ Email for account. Payment info (via processor). ZERO behavioral data. All else optional.

**"Maximum security/surveillance protection?"**
→ Offline-first, end-to-end encrypted, zero-knowledge, local data. Government gets nothing (we have nothing to give).

**"Solve all big tech/world problems?"**
→ Yes, systematically. See solutions section. Not all at once, but roadmap is clear.
