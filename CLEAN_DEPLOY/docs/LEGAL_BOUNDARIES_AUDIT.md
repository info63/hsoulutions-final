# ⚖️ LEGAL BOUNDARIES AUDIT - WHAT'S ACTUALLY ILLEGAL

**Generated:** November 27, 2025
**Purpose:** Identify truly universally illegal activities BEFORE we do them

## 🚨 TRULY UNIVERSALLY ILLEGAL (DON'T DO THESE)

### **1. Fraud & Misrepresentation**
❌ **Illegal:** Lying about capabilities to get money/investment
❌ **Illegal:** Falsifying test results or validation data
❌ **Illegal:** Impersonating someone else to get deals/access

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT

---

### **3. Copyright Infringement**
❌ **Illegal:** Using copyrighted works without permission (beyond fair use)

⚠️ If selling shares to family/friends: Need to follow private placement rules

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT (but watch if selling shares)

**Action Needed:**

---

### **5. Wire Fraud / Mail Fraud**

✅ No coordinated manipulation
✅ Algorithm-based trading (legal if honest)

**Gray Area:**
⚠️ High-frequency trading regulations vary (mostly fine for retail)

---

### **8. Money Laundering**

**What We're Doing:**
✅ All funds traceable (Kraken account, bank account, clean sources)

✅ Trading profits legitimate (algorithmic trading is legal)
✅ Paying taxes on gains (will file properly)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT

---

### **9. Tax Evasion**
❌ **Illegal:** Not reporting income
❌ **Illegal:** Falsifying deductions
❌ **Illegal:** Hiding assets offshore (without proper reporting)
❌ **Illegal:** Not paying taxes owed

**What We're Doing:**
⚠️ Need to track all income (crypto trading profits, any payments received)
⚠️ Need to file taxes properly (crypto = taxable events)
✅ H Solutions incorporated (proper business structure)
⚠️ Need to pay quarterly estimated taxes if profitable

**Status:** ⚠️ NEEDS ATTENTION

**Action Required:**
1. Track ALL crypto trades (Kraken provides reports)
2. Calculate capital gains (short-term vs. long-term)
3. File quarterly estimated taxes if profits significant (IRS Form 1040-ES)
4. File corporate taxes for H Solutions (Alaska + Federal)
5. Consider hiring accountant if profitable ($500-2000 for tax prep)

**Deadlines:**

⚠️ If partnering with foreign entities: Check export controls
⚠️ If AI becomes classified as "emerging technology": May need export license

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT (monitor if international partnerships)

**Gray Area:**
- AI/ML technology increasingly scrutinized for export control
- If OGH becomes strategic tech: Could face restrictions
- For now: Public GitHub repo is fine (educational/research exemption)

- Cookie policy (if website has cookies)
- GDPR compliance (if EU users)

---

### **12. Antitrust / Competition Law**
❌ **Illegal:** Price fixing with competitors

---

### **13. False Advertising**

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT

---

### **14. Unauthorized Practice of Professions**

❌ **Illegal:** Practicing medicine without license
❌ **Illegal:** Giving financial advice without license (if required)

**What We're Doing:**
✅ Not claiming to be lawyer (just building tech)

⚠️ OGH trading: Personal use OK, managing others' money = requires license

**Status:** ✅ COMPLIANT

**Future Risk:**
- If Liv offers financial advice: May need disclaimers ("not financial advice")

## 🟡 GRAY AREAS (LEGAL BUT WATCH CAREFULLY)

### **1. AI Training Data**
**Issue:** Copyright of training data unclear
**Our situation:** OGH learns from public data
**Risk:** Medium (evolving law)
**Mitigation:** Document sources, be transparent, prepared to defend fair use

### **2. Universal Principles Similarity to Others' Work**
**Issue:** Could someone claim prior art?
**Our situation:** Unique falsification methodology, well-documented discovery
**Risk:** Low (well-protected by documentation)
**Mitigation:** Cite related work, show differentiation, establish prior art (GitHub timestamp)

### **3. Automated Trading Regulations**
**Issue:** Some jurisdictions regulate algorithmic trading
**Our situation:** Personal trading, not managing others' money
**Risk:** Low (mostly applies to institutional)
**Mitigation:** Stay within personal trading, don't manage others' funds without license

### **4. Offering Financial Features in Liv**
**Issue:** Financial advice = regulated
**Our situation:** Planning finance module in Liv
**Risk:** Medium (depends on implementation)
**Mitigation:** Disclaimers ("not financial advice"), user education, avoid specific recommendations

### **5. Medical/Health Features in Liv**
**Issue:** Medical advice = regulated
**Our situation:** Planning health module in Liv
**Risk:** Medium (depends on implementation)
**Mitigation:** Disclaimers ("not medical advice"), wellness focus (not diagnosis), avoid specific medical claims

## 🎯 PHILOSOPHY: PROACTIVE COMPLIANCE

**Shannon's instinct:** "find like the truly universally illegal ones first"

**This is smart because:**
1. **Prevention > Cure** - Easier to avoid problems than fix them
2. **Credibility** - Clean legal record = better partnerships
3. **Focus** - Know boundaries = work confidently within them
4. **Growth** - Can't scale if legal problems crop up

**OGH's commitment:** Flag legal concerns BEFORE they become problems.
