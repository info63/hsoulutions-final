---

## NUTRITION: FUEL FOR DUAL EXCELLENCE

### CORE PRINCIPLE: 62/38 MACRO SPLIT

**Your body is an elite machine. It needs premium fuel.**

**Daily Macros (Target for 130-150 lb athlete):**
- **Protein:** 130-150g (1g per lb bodyweight)
  - Builds/repairs muscle
  - Keeps you full
  - Critical for recovery

- **Carbs:** 250-300g (enough to fuel training + brain)
  - Your brain uses 130g glucose/day just thinking
  - Basketball burns 400-600 calories/practice
  - Total: HIGH carbs needed

- **Fats:** 60-80g (hormone production, brain function)
  - Healthy fats: avocado, nuts, olive oil, salmon
  - Avoid trans fats, minimize fried food

**Total Calories:** ~2,400-2,800/day (active student-athlete)

**62/38 Applied to Meals:**
- 62% of calories from whole foods (chicken, rice, veggies, fruit)
- 38% flexible (treats, eating out, social meals)
- **Translation:** 5-6 meals are "perfect," 2-3 meals are "normal life"
- This keeps you sane, social, and consistent

### HYDRATION PROTOCOL

**Daily Target: 100+ oz water**

**Formula:**
- Bodyweight (lbs) × 0.67 = oz/day baseline
- + 20 oz per hour of practice/training
- + 16 oz for every lb lost during practice (weigh before/after)

**Timing:**
- 20 oz immediately upon waking
- 16 oz before practice
- 32+ oz during practice (sip constantly)
- 20 oz post-practice (with protein)
- 12+ oz with each meal

**Electrolytes:**
- Add to water during practice (sodium, potassium, magnesium)
- Options: LMNT, Liquid IV, coconut water
- Critical in hot gyms, long practices, game days

**Signs You're Dehydrated:**
- Dark yellow urine (should be light/clear)
- Fatigue, headache, brain fog
- Poor performance (reaction time drops 10%+ when dehydrated)

---

## BASKETBALL TRAINING: NEXT-LEVEL SKILLS

### PHILOSOPHY: 1% BETTER EVERY DAY

**62% of your athletic improvement comes from SKILL WORK, not just playing games.**

**Your Competition:**
- Most players practice 2 hours/day with team
- Good players add 30 min individual work
- **Elite players (YOU) add 1-2 hours individual skill work**

**The Math:**
- Team practice: 2 hrs × 5 days = 10 hrs/week (everyone does this)
- Individual work: 1.5 hrs × 6 days = 9 hrs/week (only elite do this)
- **Total: 19 hrs/week vs. competitors' 10 hrs**
- Over 4 years: You get 1,872 hours MORE practice than average player
- **That's the difference between D3 and D1, bench and starter, good and GREAT**

---

- Review monthly: Are you progressing? Adjust if not.

---

## BIOLOGY/PRE-MED: DOMINATE ACADEMICS

### PHILOSOPHY: STUDY SMARTER, NOT JUST HARDER

**62% of your academic success = HOW you study, not how LONG.**

**Most students:**
- Reread notes (passive, low retention)
- Cram before exams (works short-term, forget everything)
- Study alone (miss different perspectives)

**YOU (Elite Student):**
- Active recall (quiz yourself, teach others)
- Spaced repetition (review every 3, 5, 8, 13 days - Fibonacci!)
- Study groups (learn 2× faster with peers)

---

### BIOLOGY STUDY SYSTEM

**Daily Study Blocks (Total: 4-5 hours)**

**Block 1 (7:00-9:00 AM): NEW MATERIAL**
- Preview today's lectures (15 min)
  - Read textbook chapter headings, bolded terms
  - Prepare questions to ask in class
- Review yesterday's notes (30 min)
  - Rewrite key concepts in YOUR OWN WORDS
  - Draw diagrams, make flashcards
- Deep work on hardest subject (45 min)
  - Organic chemistry, biochemistry, physics
  - Practice problems, not just reading
- Break (10 min)
  - Walk, stretch, hydrate

**Block 2 (1:00-3:00 PM): LAB WORK / REVIEW**

- If no lab: Review this week's lectures
  - Make study guide, summarize each lecture in 1 page
  - Identify gaps, prepare questions for office hours

**Block 3 (8:30-10:00 PM): LIGHT REVIEW**
- Flashcards (Anki app - spaced repetition)
- Read ahead for tomorrow
- Practice problems (20-30 min)
- NOT new/hard material (brain is tired after practice)

---

### FIBONACCI SPACED REPETITION

**After Learning New Material, Review at These Intervals:**

- Day 1: Learn new concept (e.g., Krebs cycle)
- Day 3: Review (1st review - Fibonacci F(4))
- Day 8: Review (2nd review - F(6))
- Day 21: Review (3rd review - F(8))
- Day 55: Review (4th review - F(10))

**This schedule = 90%+ retention vs. 20% if you don't review.**

**Tool:** Anki flashcard app (free)
- Add cards after each lecture
- App automatically schedules reviews at optimal intervals
- 20 min/day = master entire biology curriculum

---

## MINDSET: MENTAL TOUGHNESS TRAINING

### THE 3 MENTAL SKILLS OF ELITE PERFORMERS

**1. VISUALIZATION (5 min daily)**

**Morning (after waking):**
- Close eyes, see yourself dominating
- Basketball: Perfect free throw form, hitting game-winner, lockdown defense
- Biology: Acing exam, understanding complex concept, med school acceptance letter
- Feel the emotion (confidence, joy, pride)
- **Your brain can't tell difference between vivid visualization and reality**
- Neural pathways fire the same = you actually improve by visualizing

**2. SELF-TALK (Continuous)**

**Replace negative → positive:**
- ❌ "I'm so tired" → ✅ "I'm training my body to push through"
- ❌ "This is too hard" → ✅ "This is making me better"
- ❌ "I might fail" → ✅ "I'm learning what works"

**Your Mantras (Repeat Daily):**
- "I am a student-athlete. I do hard things."
- "Discipline equals freedom."
- "Every rep, every page, every day - 1% better."
- "When I want to quit, that's when I grow."
- "Future Dr. Harvilla is being built right now."

**3. BREATHING (3-5 min, 3× daily)**

**Box Breathing (calms nervous system):**
- Inhale 4 seconds
- Hold 4 seconds
- Exhale 4 seconds
- Hold 4 seconds
- Repeat 5 times

**Use it:**
- Before free throws (game pressure)
- Before exams (test anxiety)
- After hard practice (recovery)
- Before sleep (better rest)

---

### FIBONACCI GOAL SYSTEM

**You achieve what you WRITE DOWN and REVIEW DAILY.**

**Daily Goals (3 Each Day):**
1. Basketball: (e.g., "Make 50 free throws," "5 perfect defensive slides")
2. Biology: (e.g., "Finish chapter 12," "Memorize 20 amino acids")
3. Personal: (e.g., "Drink 100 oz water," "8 hours sleep," "Call grandma")

**Weekly Goals (5 Per Week):**
- Track the big wins
- Example: "Scored 20+ points in game," "Aced biochem exam," "Ran 17s under 60 sec"

**Monthly Goals (8 Per Month):**
- Bigger milestones
- Example: "Free throw % above 85%," "GPA 3.9+," "Bench press bodyweight"

**Yearly Goals (13 Per Year - Fibonacci!):**
- Major accomplishments
- Year 1: Make team, pass all classes, develop routine
- Year 2: Start games, 3.8 GPA, first research project
- Year 3: All-conference, 4.0 semester, ace MCAT
- Year 4: Team captain, med school acceptance, graduate honors

**Review Goals:**

- Every Sunday (15 min - review week, set next week)
- Every month (30 min - assess progress, adjust)

---

## RECOVERY: THE 38% THAT MAKES THE 62% POSSIBLE

### YOU GROW DURING REST, NOT DURING WORK

**Sleep: 8 Hours Non-Negotiable**
- Growth hormone released during deep sleep
- Memories consolidated during REM sleep
- Muscles repair during sleep
- **Missing sleep = wasted training + poor grades**

**Sleep Optimization:**
- Same bedtime every night (11 PM)
- Room: cool (65-68°F), dark (blackout curtains), quiet
- No phone 1 hour before bed (blue light kills melatonin)
- Read, journal, stretch instead
- No caffeine after 2 PM

**Naps (Optional but Powerful):**
- 20-min power nap between classes (if time)
- Don't exceed 30 min (you'll wake groggy)
- Before practice if you're dragging

---

### MOBILITY & INJURY PREVENTION (15 min daily)

**Morning (upon waking):**
- Cat-cow stretch
- Hip openers
- Ankle circles
- Shoulder rolls

**Post-Practice (critical!):**
- Foam roll: IT band, quads, glutes, calves (10 min)
- Static stretching: Hold 30 sec each muscle (5 min)
- Focus: Hips (tight from basketball), ankles (stress from jumping), shoulders (shooting motion)

**Weekly (1 hour):**
- Yoga class OR deep stretching session
- Active recovery: swim, bike, walk
- Massage (if available) or foam roll + lacrosse ball deep tissue

**Red Flags (See Trainer Immediately):**
- Joint pain that doesn't go away with rest
- Sharp pain during movement
- Swelling, bruising, loss of range of motion
- **Don't play through injury - 1 week rest now > 6 months later**

---

### MENTAL RECOVERY (Daily)

**Social Time (1 hour):**
- Hang with friends, teammates
- Laugh, relax, be normal
- **You are not just athlete/student - you're a human**

**Hobbies (30 min):**
- Music, art, reading for fun, Netflix
- Something totally unrelated to basketball/biology
- Gives brain a break

**Journal (5 min before bed):**
- What went well today?
- What's one thing to improve?
- What am I grateful for?
- **Gratitude = happiness = resilience**

---

## MEDICAL SCHOOL & BEYOND

### MED SCHOOL (4 Years)

**Years 1-2: CLASSROOM**
- Hardest studying of your life
- Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology, Pathology
- 8-10 hours/day studying (athlete discipline pays off here)
- STEP 1 exam (end of Year 2, determines specialty options)

**Years 3-4: CLINICAL ROTATIONS**
- Hospital work (surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, etc.)
- Find your specialty (sports medicine? Orthopedic surgery? Family medicine?)
- STEP 2 exam
- Apply for residency (your next training)

**Your Advantage as Former Athlete:**
- Discipline (study 10 hrs/day? You've done harder)
- Resilience (handle stress, long hours, pressure)
- Teamwork (med school is collaborative)
- Physical stamina (able to stand in surgery for 8 hours)

---

### RESIDENCY (3-7 Years)

**Hours:**
- 60-80 hours/week (some weeks 100+)
- Overnight shifts, weekends, holidays
- Hardest years of your career

**But:**
- You're a DOCTOR (finally!)
- You're getting paid ($50-65K/year, not much but better than student)
- You're learning from experts
- You're saving lives

**Length by Specialty:**
- Family Medicine: 3 years
- Internal Medicine: 3 years
- Pediatrics: 3 years
- Surgery: 5 years
- Orthopedic Surgery: 5 years

**Your Life Now:**
- Doctor (MD after your name)
- Helping people, saving lives
- $200K-$400K+ salary (depending on specialty)
- Respect, impact, purpose
- Maybe private practice, maybe hospital, maybe team doctor (NBA? WNBA?)

- Mentor young athletes/students (give back)
- Work 40-60 hrs/week (residency was harder)
- Have family, hobbies, life outside work

**Looking Back:**

- 5 years residency (brutal, but you made it)
- **Total: 13 years from freshman → doctor**
- **Worth it? Absolutely.**

Every meal is in here.
Every study technique is in here.

But the guide doesn't do the work.

**62% of your day = GROWTH.**
Basketball. Biology. Building yourself into the person you're meant to be.

**38% of your day = RECOVERY.**
Rest. Friends. Family. Being human.

Nature uses it.
Elite athletes use it.
