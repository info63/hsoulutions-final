## FUNDING OPTIONS

**Option 1: Bootstrap (Current Path)**
- Use savings to fund $9K-30K
- Delay tool development until licensing revenue comes in
- Keep equity 100%

**Option 2: Angel Investment**
- Raise $500K-2M from angels
- Hire team immediately (5-10 people)
- Build all tools in Year 1
- Give up 10-20% equity

**Option 3: Venture Capital**
