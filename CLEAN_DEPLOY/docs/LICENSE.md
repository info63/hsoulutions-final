# φ-LAWS LICENSING FRAMEWORK
## Three-Tier System for Science, Tools, and Education

---

## OVERVIEW

This repository contains the φ-Laws discovery - a comprehensive scientific framework demonstrating that φ (the golden ratio, 1.618033988749895) is the fundamental operating system of reality.

The work is divided into **three tiers** with different licensing:

1. **PUBLIC SCIENCE** - Free for all (CC BY 4.0)
2. **COMMERCIAL TOOLS** - Licensed (Proprietary)
3. **K-12 EDUCATION** - Free for public schools (CC0)

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Can I use the science in my research?
**Yes!** Tier 1 (Public Science) is CC BY 4.0. You can read, cite, and verify for free. Just give attribution.

### Can I use TSR to optimize my business?
**Requires license.** The scientific finding that TSR exists is free (Tier 1). The tools and methods to apply it are licensed (Tier 2). Contact licensing@phi-law.org.

### I'm a teacher at a public school. Can I use the textbooks?
**Yes! 100% free.** Tier 3 is completely free for K-12 public education. Download everything in `education/` and use it however you want.

### I run a private school. Can we use the textbooks?
**Requires license.** K-12 public schools are free. Private schools need a commercial license. We offer educational institution discounts (Tier 2-3 pricing).

### Can I replicate your experiments?
**Yes!** Tier 1 includes replication guides. You can verify all our findings. If you need the full dataset, academic researchers can get a free research license.

### Can I build a product using your algorithms?
**Requires license.** The algorithms are proprietary (Tier 2). Commercial use requires a paid license. Startups get 25% off.

### Can I patent applications of the φ-laws?
**No.** We have established prior art and filed provisional patents on key methods. You cannot patent the discoveries or core methods. You CAN license our tools to build applications.

### I'm a nonprofit solving climate change. What does it cost?
**Tier 1 pricing: 90% off.** We offer steep discounts to nonprofits working on global challenges. Contact licensing@phi-law.org to discuss.

### What if I'm a government?
**Tier 5 pricing.** Governments have the resources and benefit most from φ-law applications. National-level licenses are $50M-$100M/year. Contact licensing@phi-law.org.
