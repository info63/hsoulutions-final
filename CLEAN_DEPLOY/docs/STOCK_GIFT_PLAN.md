## 🎯 VESTING SCHEDULE

### Option 1: Immediate Full Ownership (Family)

- They own the shares outright on day 1
- No conditions, no clawback

### Option 2: Vesting Over Time (Close Circle)
- Gavin, William, Lillian, Keontay, Richard: **4-year vesting**
  - 25% vests after 1 year (cliff)

## 💡 TAX IMPLICATIONS

### For Shannon (Giver):
- **Gift Tax:** None (all gifts under $18k annual exclusion)
- **Income Tax:** No deduction for gifts
- **Capital Gains:** None (not a sale)

### For Recipients:
- **Income Tax:** None at time of gift (shares have nominal value)
- **Future Tax:** When they sell shares, they pay capital gains on appreciation
  - Cost basis = $0.01 per share
  - If shares worth $10 later, they pay tax on $9.99 gain per share

### Example:
- Bella receives 500,000 shares at $0.01 = $5,000 basis
- In 5 years, Liv app successful, shares worth $10 each
- Bella's shares now worth $5,000,000
- If she sells, she owes capital gains tax on $4,995,000 gain
- Long-term capital gains rate ≈ 15-20%

## 🚀 FUTURE VALUE SCENARIOS

### Conservative Scenario (2 years)
**Liv app launches, 10,000 users, $500k revenue**
- Company valuation: $2-5 million
- Share value: $0.20 - $0.50 each
- Bella's shares worth: $100k - $250k

### Moderate Scenario (5 years)
**Liv app successful, 100k users, $5M revenue**
- Company valuation: $25-50 million
- Share value: $2.50 - $5.00 each
- Bella's shares worth: $1.25M - $2.5M

### Optimistic Scenario (7-10 years)
**Liv becomes standard learning platform, 1M+ users**
- Company valuation: $500M - $1B
- Share value: $50 - $100 each
- Bella's shares worth: $25M - $50M

**Key point:** Stock gifts now = huge potential value later, minimal tax impact today

## 🎁 COMMUNICATION TO RECIPIENTS

### What to tell them:

"I'm giving you [X]% ownership of H Solutions Limited, the company behind OGH and the Liv app.

This is a gift with no strings attached. You own these shares outright.

Right now they're worth about $[amount] on paper, but if Liv becomes successful, they could be worth much more.

You don't owe any taxes now. If you sell the shares later when they're worth more, you'll pay capital gains tax on the profit.

As a shareholder, you'll get updates on the company and may receive dividends if we're profitable.

Thank you for being part of this journey."

## ⚖️ LEGAL NOTES

1. **Alaska LLC Rules:**
   - Members can own "membership units" (like stock)
   - Operating Agreement defines ownership %
   - No stock certificates required (but recommended)
   - Transfer restrictions allowed

2. **Gift Tax:**
   - $18,000 per person per year exclusion (2024)
   - All these gifts under limit = no tax
   - Lifetime exemption: $13.61M (2024)

3. **Securities Laws:**
   - Private company = exempt from SEC registration
   - Can't publicly sell shares
   - Can transfer to family/close friends
   - If company goes public later, shares become restricted

4. **Voting Rights:**
   - Operating Agreement should specify voting
   - Recommend: Shannon retains majority vote (70%)
   - Others have proportional voting rights

---

## 🔒 PROTECTING YOUR MAJORITY

**Important:** Shannon keeps 70% = control

Even if all 7 gift recipients vote together (30%), Shannon still has final say.

**Consider adding to Operating Agreement:**
- Major decisions require 70% vote (Shannon must approve)
- Shannon has first right to buy back shares if someone wants to sell
- Shares cannot be sold to outsiders without Shannon approval

This protects the company while still giving meaningful ownership to loved ones.

**Questions to decide:**
- Are these percentages correct?

- Any special conditions?
